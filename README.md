# Story Wizard - Frontend

Welcome to our interactive story teller project! We created this app as part of a hackathon with one goal in mind: to make storytelling more engaging and fun for children. We all know how much kids love stories, but it can be a challenge for parents and teachers to keep up with their constant demand for new ones. That's where our project comes in – it provides a solution to this problem by offering a vast library of pre-made stories on a variety of topics, as well as the ability to generate new stories based on children's interests.

But that's not all – we've also added an exciting new feature to our app that allows children to ask follow-up questions about the stories. The app will then narrate the answers, creating an interactive experience that encourages curiosity and engagement.

Our interactive story teller is designed to be incredibly user-friendly, with a simple interface that children can easily navigate. Whether they want to browse through pre-made stories or generate a new one based on their interests, the app provides a seamless experience. And with clear, engaging narration and accompanying visuals, children can fully immerse themselves in the story.
